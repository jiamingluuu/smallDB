# smallDB
My introductory project that is used for practice my skills on writing Rust.

## Current progress
From now, I am mainly following the tutorial provided by [this](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/) website.

## Objectives
If possible, I would like to extend the program into 
1. Store all the bytes array in a multi-level B+ tree
2. Make a database concurrent, and can share stored data within multiple user process
